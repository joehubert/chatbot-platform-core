# Using AI in Support of this Project

This enterprise chatbot platform development leverages a strategic ensemble of AI tools, each selected for their unique strengths. Rather than relying on a single AI assistant, this multi-tool approach optimizes both development velocity and output quality by using specialized AI systems for specific tasks throughout the development lifecycle.
Each tool complements the others while excelling in particular domains, creating an efficient AI-powered development workflow that mirrors the platform's own multi-model routing approach.

# Tools

## Claude (Project)

### Intent
Claude (Project) will serve as the primary architectural consultant and technical lead for the chatbot platform development. It will provide comprehensive guidance on system design, implementation planning, code structure, and strategic technical decisions throughout the project lifecycle.

### Use Cases
- **System Architecture Design**: Develop the overall LangGraph pipeline structure, database schemas, and API design patterns
- **Code Generation**: Create foundational code for FastAPI endpoints, SQLAlchemy models, and core business logic components
- **Documentation Creation**: Generate comprehensive API documentation, deployment guides, and technical specifications
- **Implementation Planning**: Break down complex features into manageable development tasks with clear dependencies
- **Code Review & Optimization**: Analyze existing code for performance improvements, security vulnerabilities, and best practices
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug complex integration issues, especially around LLM provider integrations and vector database operations
- **Requirements Refinement**: Translate business requirements into detailed technical specifications
- **Testing Strategy**: Design unit test structures, integration test scenarios, and end-to-end testing approaches

### Notes
I really like using Claude for software application development. It really my righthand senior architect. Shiny AI coding tools may pop up but Claude continues to shine for me. In addition to generating code, it's great at providing high-level guidance on how projects should be approached and organized. Using projects with Claude (subscription required) allows me to add files and repos for context.

## Gemini CLI

### Intent
Gemini CLI will function as the rapid prototyping and automation specialist, focusing on quick iterations, batch processing tasks, and streamlined development workflows that complement the main development process.

### Use Cases
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly generate proof-of-concept implementations for new features or integrations
- **Batch Processing Scripts**: Create utility scripts for data migration, bulk knowledge base processing, and system maintenance tasks
- **Configuration Management**: Generate environment-specific configuration files and deployment scripts
- **Mock Data Generation**: Create realistic test datasets for conversations, documents, and user interactions
- **API Testing Scripts**: Develop automated API testing scripts and performance benchmarking tools
- **Documentation Automation**: Generate markdown documentation from code comments and API schemas
- **Deployment Automation**: Create Docker configurations, CI/CD pipeline scripts, and infrastructure-as-code templates
- **Quick Fixes & Utilities**: Handle small utility functions, data transformations, and one-off administrative tasks

### Notes
I haven't used Gemini yet but I've used Claude Code and I'm interested in checking out this more-free alternative...

## Cursor (or VS Code with Copilot)

### Intent
Cursor will be the primary coding companion for hands-on development work, providing real-time coding assistance, intelligent autocomplete, and contextual code suggestions throughout the actual implementation phase. If thresholds are exceeded (free tier), the project may make use of VS Code with GitHub Copilot.

### Use Cases
- **Active Development**: Real-time coding assistance while implementing the FastAPI application, database models, and business logic
- **Code Completion**: Intelligent autocomplete for complex function implementations, especially LangGraph pipeline components
- **Refactoring Support**: Assist with code restructuring, function extraction, and architecture improvements
- **Bug Detection**: Identify potential issues, syntax errors, and logical problems during development
- **Framework Integration**: Help with proper implementation of FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, and other framework-specific patterns
- **Test Writing**: Assist in writing comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and mock implementations
- **Database Queries**: Help craft efficient SQL queries and optimize database operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling patterns and exception management throughout the codebase

### Notes
Probably the assistant I use the least, but maybe because I'm not actively using the IDE for code generation so much...

## Manus

### Intent
Manus will be used as a research agent for marketing and promotional purposes.

### Use Cases
- **Market Research**: Analyze competitor offerings, pricing models, and positioning strategies in the SME chatbot space
- **Industry Trend Analysis**: Research emerging trends in AI, chatbots, and SME technology adoption patterns
- **Customer Persona Development**: Investigate target audience pain points, decision-making processes, and technology preferences
- **Content Strategy Research**: Identify high-performing content topics, keywords, and messaging frameworks for the target market
- **Partnership Opportunities**: Research potential integration partners, reseller channels, and strategic alliance opportunities
- **Pricing Strategy Analysis**: Benchmark competitor pricing and research SME budget allocation patterns for technology solutions
- **Case Study Research**: Identify successful chatbot implementations and ROI examples relevant to target industries
- **Marketing Channel Research**: Analyze effective marketing channels and tactics for reaching SME decision-makers

### Notes
I find the quality of Manus reports "ok", but for the speed and price (free tier for me...), it's hard to beat.
